== PROJECT: Personal Finance Tracker

---

== Overview
This portfolio aims to document the contributions made by James Pang Mun Wai to the Personal Finance Tracker.

Personal Finance Tracker is a desktop finance tracker application used for tracking personal finances such as daily expenses, recurring expenses such as monthly electricity bills, budgets and debts owed to another party. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 30 kLoC. The product was morphed from an https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[Address Book] over a period of 8 weeks under the constraints described https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/project-constraints.html[here].

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the listing feature to list expenses, debts and recurring expenses*
** What it does: allows the user to efficiently list expenses, debts and recurring expenses based on the view specified. Only items that match the view will be listed. For example, listing expense with view as the category food such as command `listexpense v/food` will lead to only expenses with the category food to be listed.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently look at groups of items based on the view specified rather than spending time to scroll through all the expenses/debts/recurring expenses.
** Highlights: This enhancement was built to be more flexible according to the user's needs. Rather than the list command from AB4 that lists all items, the updated list commands allow more specific listings. The listing features was implemented for 3 lists, namely ExpenseList, DebtList and RecurringList.
